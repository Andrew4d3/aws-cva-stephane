   requirements, for example, data must never leaves a region without
   your explicit permission
-  Proximity to customers: to reduce latency
-  Available services within a Region: new services
   and new features arenâ€™t available in every Region
-  Pricing: pricing varies from region to region and is
   transparent in the service pricing page
